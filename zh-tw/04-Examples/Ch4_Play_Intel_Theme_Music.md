  As WuKong master, gateway, node programs can all run on a computer, we start the first example by using only software modules on the computer.   
The example is built in four steps:

  Step 1. [Start Master and gateway programs](OP1/Ch4_part_1_start_master_and_gateway_program.md) 

  Step 2. [Include New Device](OP1/Ch4_part_2_include_new_device.md)  
  
  Step 3. [Build the FBP](OP1/Ch4_part_3_deploy_dbp_application.md).  
  
  Step 4. [Running the Application](OP1/Ch4_part_4_testing.md)
