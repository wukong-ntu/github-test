#Chapter 6: Building New WuClasses 

IoT applcation  developers  may create new WuClasses in WuKong to enrich their application design and to connect to new hardware. In this chapter, we show how to create new WuClasses in four sections:   

1. In the WuKong Profile Framework section, we explain the system architecture of the WuKong Profile Framework running on each device node.

2. [Adding a New WuClass Definition](Ch6_Add_a_New_Definition.md) shows how to add a new WuClass definition in the WuKong WuClass library.  
   
   Once a new WuClass is defined, a new entry will be created in the available WuClasses panel when restarting  Master's FBP editor.   
   
3. In the [Implement a WuClass from Definition](Ch6_Implement_a_WuClass_by_Definition.md), we go through the template of WuClass implementation.  
   
   Using the template, developers can implement  specific functionalities for the WuKong components defined earlier.
   
4. We show some examples on WuClasses built for Grove Sensor Modules. These modules are the most commonly used in many IoT applications.
