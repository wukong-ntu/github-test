#Chapter 4: Simple Examples of Deploying WuKong 

This chapter gives two simple examples on how to deploy an IoT application in a WuKong system. The first application runs on a computer only, without connecting to any IoT board. The second application shows how to build an application on Intel Edison or Raspberry Pi boards. Both examples run on a local area network with no Internet connection required.  

<!--
we will use two examples to show the WuKong programming environment. This demonstration includes how to run WuKong system, manage devices, and deploy application. By finishing this section, you can have a basic idea about how WuKong works.
  
Before diving into the details, we first look at the WuKong programming editor as below. This editor is for creating Flow-Based Program (FBP), an intuitive IoT application flow. In this example, we use two IoT applications to follow two setups as mentioned in the **[Ch2](../Ch2/Ch2_WuKong_Environment_Setup.md)**. In the first FBP, when a UI buttion is clicked, it will send a signal to trigger Intel_sound component, and the the Intel theme will be played.  Similarly, in the second FBP, when the button changes its current value, this value will be propagated through a data link to control light actuator.
