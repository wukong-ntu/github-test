###4.1.4 Running the Application

After the deployment, we can use the http requests to send 0 or 1 to UIButton and check if the theme music is played. Since WuKong adopts the even-driven model, data will propagate along a link only when its value is changed; therefore, we must send 0 before sending 1.
