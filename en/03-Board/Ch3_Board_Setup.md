#Chapter 3: Preparing IoT Boards for WuKong

Many IoT boards and devices are now available on the market. Each  IoT device or sensing board must be pre-configured with the WuKong middleware before it can be managed by the WuKong Master as a WuKong device. In this chapter, we present the set up procedure for three commonly available boards: **[Intel Edison](Ch3_Board_Setup_for_Intel_Edison.md)**, **[Intel Galileo Gen2](Ch3_Board_Setup_for_Intel_Galileo_Gen_2.md)**, and **[Raspberry Pi 2](Ch3_Boardsetup_for_Raspberry_Pi_Board.md)**. <!-- For all boards except Arduino, the vendor-supported Linux OS must be installed first. The boards also must be set up to run Python and OpenSSL. -->
